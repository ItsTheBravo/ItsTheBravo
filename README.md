# Hi, I'm John McGrath!

## From Optimizing Supply Chains to Building Data Solutions

I spent 7 years in supply chain operations learning one truth: good data drives good decisions. Bad data costs money.

Now I'm building the technical skills to turn messy business problems into clean analytics solutions.

## Why Supply Chain Plus Data Science

Most data analysts learn tools but lack domain knowledge. Most supply chain people understand the business but lack technical depth.

I'm building both.

When you understand demand forecasting, inventory turns, and supplier lead times, you ask better questions. When you know Python, SQL, and Power BI, you answer them faster.
